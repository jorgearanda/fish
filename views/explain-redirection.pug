    h1 FISH REDIRECTION FEATURES
    h3 Hello, FISH Experimenter!
    div.remark
    p.
        If your FISH experiment is part of a chain, 
        such as a survey on platform A followed by FISH followed by another questionaire on platform B,
        you will want to sent participants into FISH without needing them to log in to FISH in the usual 
        form-based, manual way. And you want participants to automatically be redirected to platform B 
        when they complete your FISH experiment.
    h4 Transparently sending your participants into FISH
    p.
        This can be accomplished by providing platform A the standard FISH URL with 2 query parameters:
    dl
        dt expid
        dd the ID of the FISH experiment
        dt partid
        dd the ID of the FISH participant
    p.
        For example, provide platform A the following FISH URL: 
    tt
        small #{myHost}/?expid=XWDJ6X&partid=225
    p 
    p.
        Of course, instead of '225' you may be able to use platform A's mechanism to put in the actual participant's id.

    h4 Transparently sending your participants from FISH to the next best thing
    p.
        Your experiment design (the "microworld") can include a Redirection URL, 
        which FISH will use to send participants to another web site after completing the experiment. 
        (This happens when participants click the OK button on the pop-up window announcing 
        the completion of the experiment.)
    p.
        Before executing this, FISH will perform variable substition on the URL using any query parameters 
        that were passed in when FISH started. Two additional variables are also available for substitution:
    dl
        dt fishTotal
        dd the total number of fish caught by the participant
        dt profitTotal
        dd the total earnings of the participant
    p.
        For example, you could put the following in the Redirection URL textbox: 
    tt
        small.
            https://www.payme.com/?subj=$(partid)&catch=${fishTotal}&earned=${profitTotal}

    h4 Transparently sending your participants from FISH back to the previous platform
    p.
        If platform B is actually the same as platform A 
        (i.e., you want the participant to go back to platform A after completing your FISH experiment)
        you can get platform A to provide one or more other query parameters that should be used
        to enable participants to continue on that platform where they left off upon completion of the FISH experiment.
        FISH will capture those query parameters, which you can then include in the Redirection URL 
        using variable substitution.

    h4 An example going from the survey platform GORILLA to FISH and back to GORILLA
    p.
        In Gorilla, create a Redirect Node and configure it as follows: 
    dl
        dt URL
        dd Set this to: <tt><small> #{myHost}/?expid=<i>YOURFISHEXPERIMENTID</i> </small></tt>
        dt Append Public ID
        dd Name this: <tt><small> partid </small></tt>
        dt Completion dropdown menu
        dd Select 'Completion Token'

    p In FISH, in your experiment's microworld parameters, set the Redirect URL to: 
    tt
        small https://research.sc/participant/login/resume/${completion_token}
    
    p 
    p That should do it!
